# Hotel Carone voiceover source
Source files for the Hotel Carone Deus Ex mod voiceover. Contains original mp3 files, import script and modified .con files.
The "InfoLink.7z" archive contains source files without "infolink" effect.


To compile:
* Copy the HotelCarone directory to your DeusEx base directory.
* Modify the "DeusEx.ini" file and add HotelCarone to EditPackages.
* Compile like any other package, or use the "_Build.cmd" command file.
* Copy HotelCaroneAudioHC.u and HotelCaroneText.u files from the HotelCarone\Built\ to DeusEx\HotelCarone\System\

Warning! Ignore the "HotelCarone.u" file, otherwise this will break the mod. Just delete this file.
